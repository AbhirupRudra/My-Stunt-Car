# 🚗 IoT-Enabled Stunt Car  

A revamped **stunt car project** where an old toy car has been upgraded with modern electronics. The original circuitry was replaced with an **ESP8266 microcontroller**, enabling **Internet-based control**. The car is powered through **Embedded C programming** in Arduino IDE, integrates an **L293D motor driver** for motor control, and maintains the original **music circuitry**. Additionally, the car’s lights have been automated.  

All **motors, lights, and music** can now be controlled wirelessly through an **open-source mobile application**.
